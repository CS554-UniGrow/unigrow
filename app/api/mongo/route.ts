Such data sets, which continuously and rapidly grow over time, are referred to as Big Data Streams. Analysis of streaming data poses a number of unique challenges which are not easily solved through direct applications of well-known data mining methods and algorithms developed for traditional static data. This course will serve as a first course on the emerging field of "Data Streams Analytics". It will provide an introduction to IoT, sensors & devices, the architecture and environment in which these devices generate data streams, the data quality & data cleaning, data acquisition, and emerging methodologies and algorithms for knowledge discovery from data streams. Topics include: synopsis & sampling techniques, sliding windows, computing the entropy in streams, data streams correlations, change detection, outliers & anomaly detection.',

    course_description:
      "Many major medical device design practices have been established or changed as a result of an event or group of events. This course examines current practices and their relationship to events which shaped them, providing rationale and historical context for these practices. Spanning the past century, this course begins by examining events which shaped early medical device regulations and standards. It describes the ramifications of those events and how guidelines and rules for medical device design were formulated or changed as a result. It then reviews unique considerations in current medical device design practices, including regulatory, research and reimbursement practices and special challenges in clinical use. Medical devices that were marketed but resulted in poor outcomes or with technical flaws are studied to illustrate general themes among goals and needs for improved medical device design practices in the future. Aiming to expose students to broadly relevant and current issues, in its entirety, this course reviews the top causes of death, the most expensive diseases and illnesses, and current performance issues with common medical devices. Each lesson summarizes at least one critical element of design strategy for medical devices. Selected examples represent common medical device design challenges. This course is geared toward students seeking or recently entering a career in medical devices. In many cases, medical device practices were based upon practices established for drug regulation, and so relevant pharmaceutical industry developments are also presented, making this course interesting and pertinent to a student pursuing a career in the pharmaceutical field as well. It is also strongly applicable to those pursuing careers involving technology in clinical settings, including hospitals, and in pre-clinical/clinical research. The material that is presented includes highlights from several hundred references. Most of the references are publicly available. Students are encouraged to review the references in their entirety if they want to know more about a topic. Recognizing the multi-disciplinary nature of this field, the course is suitable for a student in any engineering and science program.",

The modes of rehabilitation to be evaluated fall across the spectrum from surgical intervention, strength and coordination training, use of assistive devices, and feedback control principles for advanced human-machine interfaces such as neuro-prostheses and powered exoskeletons. Students will be exposed to advanced concepts of neuromuscular physiology and biomechanical assessment. Learning materials will include lecture presentations, literature reviews, building experimental databases, and assignments using simulation software. The course will conclude with a final project that includes a research proposal and executing a related pilot experiment primarily through simulation.",

    course_description:
      'Students are invited to learn the fundamentals of musculoskeletal rehabilitation and design and test a "biofeedback" device that teaches the end-user about body movement mechanics. Biofeedback is used in rehabilitation and in other movement-training paradigms to facilitate motor (re-)learning \u2013 conveying biological sensor data to the end-user either concurrently (real-time) or terminally, after the movement is complete. For example, one emerging type of real-time biofeedback uses precise musical cues to convey biomechanics metrics to help people learn movement skills. Students will work in groups to design and experimentally evaluate an audio and/or visual biofeedback device of their choosing, as they develop skills using biomechanical sensors through lab assignments and communicate their device development in an IEEE-style paper. An additional unique aspect of the course is its community engagement: students will share their designs with younger students and/or the public, which will build students\u2019 abilities to present and teach new concepts.',

      "Advances in lab-on-a-chip (LOC) technology have led to the development of a wide variety of innovative miniaturized platforms for basic research and point-of-care applications by allowing integration of large-scale laboratory operations onto a fully integrated small-scale device. Compared with traditional benchtop operations, LOC-based assays offer a broader range of unique advantages. In particular, compact LOC devices can carry out cost-effective, rapid, and portable biochemical analyses with considerably high resolution and sensitivity through the use of small amounts of reagents and samples (typically, several micro-liters) in a tightly controlled user-defined environment. The overall goal of this course is to help students gain comprehensive understanding of the field of LOC, including device fabrication methods, recent technologic progress, current challenges and limitations to overcome, and future perspectives, with special focus on biomedical applications of different LOC devices. Notably, this course will highlight cutting-edge LOC technologies that enabled creation of devices for low-cost gene extraction and sequencing, accurate single-cell analysis, and high-throughput drug screening. Further, students will learn innovative LOC devices that are being used for high-fidelity in vitro disease modeling and therapeutic development. In particular, this course will review organ-on-a-chip (OOC) platforms that can recapitulate the complex structures, functions, as well as dynamic responses of living human organs.",

In this course, fundamental concepts of mechanics such as continuum mechanics, viscoelasticity, growth, buckling, and mechanical experimentation will be used to understand the relation between brain function and form in health and disease. Students will be exposed to advanced concepts of the physiology and mechanical assessment of the nervous system. Learning materials will include lecture presentations, literature reviews, experimental data, and homework assignments. The course will conclude with a final project that may be a literature review, experimental study, or computational study and includes a project report.",

We will explore this in the context of the major decisions made by senior management, as opposed to day-to-day decision-making. As a survey course we will only highlight the theory and detailed mechanics of complex decision-making. Our focus will be to discuss the issues faced by executives in solving complex problems that require their attention and review the methods used by business executives to handle uncertainty, mitigate risk and create outcomes that address the needs of the business. Throughout the course we will examine the decision-making process from the perspective of different departments; marketing, sales, corporate planning, production, financing, etc. While many of the planning, financial and analytical tools are common, their application within different departments can and will vary. The course will consist of two components: 1. Lectures and reading on decision-making tools, methods and procedures. 2. Business case discussion on the application of decision-making tools to timely issues faced by leading corporations.",

This new reality necessitates addressing questions ranging from business ethics to social responsibility to better understanding the role between "socially responsible" Marketing and the financial performance of firms. There is also a vast and growing field of Non-Profit Marketing, generally not covered in Marketing courses, which offers students opportunities to pursue marketing in a context not dictated by profit assumptions.',

The class covers deontological and utilitarian ethics in their canonical form in Kant and Mill. Various methods and approaches that either criticize or transform these ethical theories are discussed in order to explore the theoretical options open to a 21st century ethicist. In addition to the basic moral theories, the class covers some of the necessary elements of human agency, i.e. free will, responsibility, and motivation. Finally, it covers some work in social ethics that has particular relevance for questions of economic justice and injustice.",

    course_description:
      "The course gives an introduction to the key issues and methodologies of bioethics. It refers to the central problems in bioethics (autonomy of the patient, organ transplantation, stem cell debate, cloning, etc.), as much as to newer developments, such as genetic enhancement and the commercialization of the body. A main focus is to explore the field of bioethics in an interdisciplinary way and to bring not only ethical, legal, or scientific criteria into play, but also those from an existential, social, or cultural background. An introduction to the moral theories used in applied ethics is given. The course helps to develop a responsible and sensitive conduct in future studies or occupations.",

In addition to the traditional topics of induction and confirmation, falsification, theory-ladeness of observation, demarcation, realism/instrumentalism/relativism debates, and the "science wars" of the late 20th century, special attention is given to current debates regarding the role of cultural, sociological, and psychological factors in scientific work as well as the state of particular scientific fields. Readings include such seminal figures as Hempel, Carnap, Duhem, Goodman, Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, and Feyerabend, as well as contemporary thinkers like Putnam, McMullin, van Fraassen, and Kitcher.',

Questions addressed include the following: Should we be concerned about the impact of human life on the environment? To what extent should sacrifices be made in order to protect the environment? Which ethical frameworks are most effective in resolving disputes? To what extent are solutions based purely on economic concerns inadequate? Special attention will be given to the ways in which traditional ethical theories must be amended in order to address environmental concerns.",

The students will also develop an understanding of how to design a monitoring program to collect the data that are appropriate for simulating a natural system. Current state and federal guidelines and regulations will be discussed including the development of a waste load allocation for a point source, a load allocation for a nonpoint source and a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for an impaired waterway. This course will not only provide the student with the tools necessary to simulate a watershed but also provide a keen insight into the watershed management process.

The thermodynamics of the atmosphere are derived based on the equation of state of the atmosphere with specific emphasis on adiabatic and pseudo-adiabatic motions. The concept of atmospheric stability is presented in terms of the moist and dry lapse rate. The influence of the planetary boundary layer on atmospheric motions is presented with emphasis on topographic and open ocean frictional effects, temperature discontinuity between land and sea, and the generation of sea breezes. The mesoscale dynamics of tornadoes and hurricanes are discussed as well as the cyclogenesis of extratropical coast allows. The course makes use of a multitude of web-based products including interactive learning sites, weather forecasts from the National Weather Service (NWS), tropical predictions from the National Hurricane Center and NWS model outputs (AVN, NGM, ETA, and WAM).",

The fundamental data bases the sources for the basic hypotheses and the resultant theories are the accelerograms and the isoseismal maps.

      "This course will focus on the design of hydraulic structures including small dams, spillways, weirs and culverts. These are complex structures, the design of which must account for the water forces, which act upon them as well as their impacts upstream and downstream. Structural topics will be covered along with backwater curves and downstream effects. Models such as the US Army HEC II and HEC RAS will be used to model the associated hydraulic impacts of these structures. Structural models will also be used were appropriate to assist in the design of the structures. Environmental and economic implications of hydraulic structures will also be addressed.",

The examination committee consists of at least four qualified faculty members from Stevens, with at least three members from within the CEOE department. The advisor will inform the student about the particular details of the exam.The qualifying examination consists of a written part and an oral part. It covers broad topics related to the student\u2019s academic interests and topics that are relevant to the research area of the student. Students must take this exam no later than the end of the third semester after their first enrollment at a CEOE doctoral program. A full-time Ph.D. student needs to have completed at least 18 credit hours before he/she can take the Ph.D. qualifying exam. The exam is given on or about the 1st week of October for students first enrolled in the Fall semester of the previous year and on or about the 1st week of March for students first enrolled in the Spring semester of the previous year. A part-time Ph.D. student has one more year to take the qualifying exam (i.e., in the beginning of the 5th semester). For a Ph.D. student coming to CEOE without a MS degree, He/she will need to finish 30 credit hours to meet the MS requirement first and then can plan for the Ph.D. qualifying exam.The qualifying examination starts with a written (take-home) part (organized by the advisor) that must be completed within one week. The Examination Committee has one week to grade this exam. If the student passes the written part, the advisor will schedule the oral part of the exam within about one week of passing the written part.The student must pass both written and oral parts of the exam.If a student fails the written part of the exam they must retake the whole exam within six months. If a student passes the written part and fails the oral part they have to retake the oral part within 6 months. If the student does not pass the qualifying exam after two attempts, the student will be dismissed from the Ph.D. program. A student fails if at least two committee members vote negatively irrelevant of the number of committee members.",

From the viewpoint of the process simulations, the course is divided into four categories: Component, property and data management; Unit operations; System simulation; and Process economic evaluation. The equations used by the simulator are discussed as well as convergence methods, loops and tear streams and scrutiny of default settings in the simulator. The factored cost method and profitability measures are reviewed and compared to simulator results. Work on a capstone design project is begun in the last section of the course.",

    course_description:
      'This course is a "gentle introduction" to quantum Networking and quantum security. Quantum networking uses quantum computing and this course will start with the review of quantum computing fundamentals. It will concentrate on quantum networking, teleportation, and Quantum TCP/IP protocols that facilitates fast and secure transmission of information in the form of quantum bits, also called qubits, between physically separated quantum nodes (processors). It presents the concepts and workings of quantum networking systems in a way that does not require students to have knowledge beyond the senior level in a typical degree program in computer science, electrical engineering, or physics. More specifically, Quantum teleportation (Quantum Internet) that uniquely uses quantum phenomena, like superposition, no-cloning, entanglement, entanglement distribution that are not available to classical networks, will be examined.',

    course_description:
      'The objective of this course is to give students a basic grounding in designing and implementing distributed and cloud systems, including issues in the implementation of backend services in the cloud itself. What are global consensus and Paxos, and what is their application in building cloud systems? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using distributed NoSQL stores such as Cassandra instead of relational stores such as MySQL? What are strong and weak consistency, what are the "CAP Theorem" and the "CALM Theorem," and what are their implications for building highly available services? What is a blockchain, such as the Bitcoin blockchain, and how does it relate to issues in coordinating distributed systems? What are the roles of REST, Websockets and stream processing in cloud applications? This course will combine hands-on experience in developing cloud services, with a firm grounding in the tools and principles for building distributed and cloud applications, including advanced architectures such as peer-to-peer and publish-subscribe. Besides cloud services, we will also be looking at cloud support for batch processing, such as the Hadoop framework, and its use with NoSQL data stores, such as Cassandra. Prerequisites: Graduate students - Undergraduate data structures and algorithms OR CS 590. Undergraduate students - CS 385.',

More importantly, is it possible to achieve the best of the two worlds, or there has to be some trade-off. This course will introduce students to concepts relating the computational efficiency and the statistical accuracy for a broad range of problems, including regression, classification, clustering, adaptive learning, to name a few. It will cover popular numerical methods that carry out state-of-the-art performance on the computational side, and it will also discuss possible improvement in the price of estimation accuracy and memory usage. The goal of the course is to help students understand these trade-offs from a theoretical perspective and guide them to design near-optimal algorithms for real-world problems.",

This includes review of network traffic logs (pcap, flow records) and profiles and their types, identification of attack signatures and fingerprints, study of various traceback methods, application of data mining techniques, and the extraction of information (e.g., from malware, including botnet traffic) acquired through the use of network analysis tools and techniques, recovering evidence left behind, and technologies that can be used to assist in the analysis of obtained data or in obtaining more data. We will look into methodologies for recovering data from persistent storage and memory. Investigate the use of virtual machines in providing auditing capabilities to analysts and in setting traps for attackers. The class will not only cover the subjects in theory but instead also provide the students with an extensive hands-on experience. The class will involve a fair amount of programming.",

In particular, students must remain in good standing throughout the practicum; prior approval of the graduate program coordinator, in consultation with the student\u2019s academic advisor, is required for enrollment; the student must show evidence of a real commitment from a specific employer for a specific project, with preferably a detailed description of the project and job responsibilities. All these materials, including a job offer letter, must be provided to the program coordinator with sufficient advance notice so that the program coordinator has time to review the materials and determine if the project is appropriate. During the semester, the student must submit written monthly progress reports. At the end of the semester, the student must submit for grading a written report that describes their activities, even if the project is ongoing.

However, these digital signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques will be supplemented by analog signal processing techniques, which continue to be important for front-ends of receivers (and will remain important as carrier frequencies continue to migrate to higher frequencies). In addition to covering the mathematical principles of digital and analog signal processing, the course will cover contemporary digital signal processors. The data processing issue arises in the coding of data for improved communications performance. Compression algorithms, reducing the amount of data that must be transmitted, coding techniques to provide error detection/protection, and encryption techniques to improve security are representative examples of data processing.",

      "Control of Wireless Communications Systems Provides the student with depth in the overall understanding of the high-level definition and operation of a contemporary wireless system. Since many wireless systems involve connections among hardware developed by different commercial manufacturers, national and international standards play a major role in the evolution of wireless systems. Earlier first generation systems evolved to today\u2019s second generation systems, with third generation systems expected shortly. One component of this course relates to these important standards. There are several fundamentally different wireless systems applications simultaneously evolving. Some relate to personal communications services (e.g., cellular telephony, wireless modems, etc.). Others relate to LANs, implemented in wireless rather than wired technologies to allow mobility or ease of access but providing data rates competitive with wired systems. Satellite communications systems (e.g., the Iridium system) are emerging and promise to provide a particularly interesting means of extending communication services. GPS systems provide an important means of determining one\u2019s position to high accuracy. Digital and software radios exploit the familiar concept of radio transmissions to provide digital information (and draw upon channel assignment schemes related to the radio metaphor). In addition to the commercial development of separate (and non-integrated) wireless systems of the various types above, there are important military applications in which the various systems are integrated to provide a versatile communications systems designed for battlefield applications. Upon completion of this course, the student will have depth of understanding in the high-level, systems-oriented view of wireless systems.",

By resolving questions of rhetoric and language through text analysis and class discussions, students become more critical readers and effective writers. Additionally, refining the use of stylistic tools, such as structure, syntax, and vocabulary, will result in clearer and more precise written and verbal communication. Through a variety of task-based activities, such as email writing, Problem-Solution and Process writing, data commentary, and summary writing, the ELC 90 student will have the opportunity to improve the communication of both sourced and non-sourced information. Students will also refine critical elements of pronunciation by giving formal and informal presentations.",

The course aims to provide the foundation for healthcare data analytics. Topics such as cost analysis, machine learning, and visualizations will be discussed in the context of analytic applications. The course dives into healthcare data and hands-on programming, leaning more toward a data scientist with healthcare specialty. Students will learn to select, prepare, analyze, interpret, evaluate, and present data related to health system performance and clinical effectiveness. More specifically, student will learn: How to design and construct data models using data science techniques How to use data science methods to make critical decisions in the healthcare setting, and measure the cost effectiveness of clinical interventions or processes within the domains of finance and operations. While there are no formal prerequisites for this course, students are expected to have a foundation in applied mathematics including probability and statistics such as found in an undergraduate engineering program.",

This course aims at teaching students how to use technology and management strategies to develop effective policies achieving and supporting the operation of sustainable urban systems. Throughout the course various quantitative decision making methods and tools including decision trees, benefit-cost and cost-effective analyses, and more advanced decision and risk analysis methods including sensitivity analysis, and multi-criteria decision theories will be examined. A diverse set of urban system case studies including but not limited to mobility, food, water, energy, and waste management will be assessed and analyzed using these techniques and tools. By the end of the course students should be able to quantitatively assess urban systems and their implications on environment, health and well-being, economic development and equity as well as stakeholders\u2019 roles and responsibilities to make holistic decisions and policy choices. Integration of risk and uncertainty into formal methods is a fundamental component of this course, which tells us how confident we should be in our analyses while formulating/ revising policies.",

      'This course surveys the diverse projects (visual arts, design, and architecture) of three important avant-garde movements: Constructivism in the newly-formed Soviet Union, de Stijl and "neo-plasticism" in the Netherlands, and the German Bauhaus from its founding to its demise in 1933. The artists and designers of these movements responded to contemporary political and social upheavals with utopian projects intended to inform lived social existence. The course investigates whether it is possible to found imagined societies with advanced design, visual arts, and architecture. Topics include: the notion of utopian societies, the relation between social change and design and urban planning, and the idea of the artist as engineer and founder of progressive societies.',

It is expected that Internship will run approximately 8 to 12 hours per week for 14 weeks (or 112 to 168 hours per academic session) per 3 credits. A scheduled bi-weekly meeting with a group to discuss internships and career interests is expected. The student\u2019s internship performance will be evaluated by the following: a) a weekly journal describing the student\u2019s involvement in various activities and projects; b) an approximately five-page reflective essay in which the student integrates prior coursework with the internship experience (a theory and practice exercise); c) a basic report indicating the extent to which scope of work was accomplished; d) attendance and participation in group meetings; e) a written evaluation from the student\u2019s supervisor; f) a portfolio of work accomplished during the internship, if appropriate.

By sampling a wide array of works, notably films and literary texts, the course aims to destabilize normative sexual expectations while considering the consequences of social constructions to which individuals are conventionally subjected. Although the course focuses primarily on gay history, parallels to, and intersections with, issues of importance elsewhere in the GLBTQ community are indicated in lectures.",

The artists and designers of these movements responded to contemporary political and social upheavals with utopian projects intended to inform lived social existence. The course investigates whether it is possible to found imagined societies with advanced design, visual arts, and architecture. Topics include: the notion of utopian societies, the relation between social change and design and urban planning, and the idea of the artist as engineer and founder of progressive societies.',

      'This course is a social and cultural history of engineering prehistoric times through the 14th century CE. It examines the nature and the role of the engineer and engineering in a global context in the pre-modern period. Through a series of case studies involving lecture, reading, discussion, and technical demonstrations, the course will examine the technical, economic, political, ideological, and cultural factors that can influence the contents, direction, location, and rhythm of engineering innovation. Particular attention will be paid to the variety of engineering approaches in the pre-modern world, and to non- western attitudes towards technology. This course complements HHS 466, from "Water, Wind & Steam: Engineering from 1400 \u2013 1700" and "Engineering Empire from 1700 to the Present," but none of these courses is a prerequisite for any of the others.',

Students will consider the historical context of when the films were made as well as how they speak to the present moment.",

In this context, we study poems such as William Wordsworth\u2019s Prelude, Samuel Taylor Coleridge\u2019s Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and prose such as Dorothy Wordsworth\u2019s Grasmere and Alfoxden journals and Thomas De Quincey\u2019s Confessions of an English Opium-Eater.",

    course_description:
      "From the ancient times to the present, literature has engaged political issues. This course traces the intrigues of civil and familial power as captured in significant literary works which offer profound statements, creatively wrought, about vital moral, social and political principles concentrating on works up to the Renaissance. Questions such as whether civilizations can expect their leaders to be ethical in addition to powerful or what happens to society when leaders confront evolving social conditions such as wars, civil unrest or new legal systems or what interplay there may be among the leader (often a man), his family, and the led will be examined in a variety of genres, such as tragedy and epic, and can be explored by invoking the moral imagination. By considering these questions through the vehicle of fiction, literature elicits not only the audience or readers\u2019 intellect, but their emotions as well \u2013 in both cases, by means of reader-response. One pressing question we will tackle is whether fiction that engages issues of power and politics does \u2013 or can function to \u2013 change the world.",

Rather, it focuses on important core works in the genres of symphonic, chamber, and choral and solo vocal music, primarily from the common practice period extending from the late Renaissance to the late Romantic period, without excluding important trends and developments in earlier (medieval) and later (modern, post- modern) periods. The aim throughout is to focus on works that an interested music lover is liable to hear in live performance, and that form a basis for further musical exploration. At the same time, the course provides, without losing this central focus, at least brief exposure and consideration of selected examples of both world music and commercial pop music in some of its various forms. Finally, and unique to the Music and Technology program at Stevens, the course draws special attention, wherever appropriate, to important milestones in the development of music technology and their impact on the development of musical style.",

Also, it is unclear how the reality of evil can be reconciled with the idea of the supreme goodness of God. The problem of good and evil raises the questions of human nature, the existence of free will, and humans\u2019 basic attitude toward suffering. In modernity, the problem of evil was given further emphasis through the advent of nihilism, for which no moral obligations exist, and the mass extinction carried out by totalitarian regimes.

To illuminate these issues, we will consider alternative contemporary perspectives in political philosophy, including liberal, communitarian, and feminist approaches, and will examine their implications for politics in the context of emerging global frameworks.",

While data, in general, has become increasingly abundant, raw data and statistical inferences are often insufficient in of themselves to support decision making. Addressing complicated societal problems such as climate change, economic inequality, and cybersecurity requires successful communication of the inferences and findings drawn from the analysis of data. One way to communicate inferences is through storytelling. In this course, students will learn how to tell stories with data through case studies, examples, and hands-on experimentation. While basic methods for research, cleaning, and analysis of datasets will be covered, the focus will be on creative methods of data presentation and storytelling. Students will consider the emotional, aesthetic, and practical effects of different presentation methods as well as how to develop metrics for assessing impact.",

Research shows that the psychology of the left and the right favor different styles of political media. Specific topics covered include: the history of political (and partisan) media, psychological theories of media consumption, biological foundations of political attitudes and behavior, the role of the media environment and choice, partisan polarization, and the impacts of media psychology on political behavior.",

To address these questions, we will, first of all, investigate theories and studies that explain gender differences from biological and cultural perspectives. then, we will analyze how gender shapes and is shaped by large social institutions such as education, the workplace, the family, politics, and media. In this course, we will also explore the intersections of gender, race, class and sexual orientation. The readings, class discussions, and assignments are designed to help students improve their critical thinking skills, understand the social construction of gender, learn about sociological research, and develop their communication skills.",

While data, in general, has become increasingly abundant, raw data and statistical inferences are often insufficient in of themselves to support decision making. Addressing complicated societal problems such as climate change, economic inequality, and cybersecurity requires successful communication of the inferences and findings drawn from the analysis of data. One way to communicate inferences is through storytelling. In this course, students will learn how to tell stories with data through case studies, examples, and hands-on experimentation. While basic methods for research, cleaning, and analysis of datasets will be covered, the focus will be on creative methods of data presentation and storytelling. Students will consider the emotional, aesthetic, and practical effects of different presentation methods as well as how to develop metrics for assessing impact.",

It demonstrates how developments in scientific research and technological development drove the creation of an immense military-industrial- academic enterprise. The Cold War precipitated an arms race that led to a new social reality based upon Mutually Assured Destruction. Students will learn how nuclear weapons have shaped international relations in the 21st Century, how non-state entities and the related possibilities of nuclear terrorism have come into prime focus, and how societies have integrated the production of nuclear energy. They also will gain a greater appreciation for the cultural novelties of the nuclear era, as well as for the changing social and political contexts of decision-making. Throughout the whole course, the existential threat of nuclear weapons technologies will be examined and discussed.",

The first part of the course focuses on spatial data, highlighting the generalization to the Euclidean plane from a onedimensional indexing typical of time series. The second part of the course deals with spatiotemporal data, emphasizing how concepts can then be extended further to indexing of higher dimensions. The course balances the mathematical study of the properties of models with the computational aspects involved in their implementation and the interpretation of real-life data examples, the latter relying on the statistical software and environment R.",

These methods are based on the rank-structured approximation of multivariate functions and operators by using appropriate tensor decompositions (formats). The old and new rank-structured tensor formats are presented, as: canonical, Tucker, hierarchical, tensor train, quantized tensor train formats and their generalizations, which leads to tensor networks, i.e. representation of high dimensional tensors as interconnected low dimensional tensors in variety of ways. Under suitable conditions these formats allow a stable representation and a reduction of the data size from exponential complexity (with respect to the dimension of the space) to a linear complexity, which kills the curse of dimensionality. Another goal of the course is to present variety of relatively novel unsupervised machine learning methods using matrix and tensor decompositions, as latent variable analysis based on (1) statistical independence and (2) sparsity assumptions, kernel and generalized principal component analysis, and non-negative tensor decomposition, all of which reveal hidden patterns in the data.",

They relate physical characteristics, e.g., fluid velocity, displacement, temperature, etc., and their derivatives as functions of time and space. Analytical solutions of PDEs are available only in some simple cases, and for almost any real-life problem, PDEs can be solved only approximately by numerical methods. This course introduces the widely used finite difference and finite element methods and discusses conditions under which the numerical schemes are stable and converge to the true solutions of the PDEs; the latter is critical for understanding when the predictions from the approximations obtained by the numerical methods can be trusted. The course also offers projects, where the students can implement the finite difference and finite element methods for proposed problems.

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) provides a valuable approach for extracting characteristics of complicated data by recognizing the \u2018shape\u2019 of the data. TDA-based algorithms have been successfully used for tasks such as identifying new cancer types, detecting warning signals for imminent financial market crashes, and optimizing materials for methane capture. As a generalization of graphs, simplical complexes formed from data are used for recognizing topological properties algorithmically and are introduced with natural motivating examples from areas such as neuroscience and multi-agent decision tasks. With this in mind, we turn to algebraic topology, specifically simplicial homology, and then follow the development and implementation of persistent homology. Common challenges in data science, such as clustering and dimension reduction, are repeated themes and appear naturally in the Mapper algorithm. Examples of applications are given throughout the course, with coding mostly in Python. Prerequisites: Undergraduate linear algebra, basic familiarity with Python, Matlab or R",

    course_description:
      "This course provides the educational framework, supervision, and awards credits for off-campus internships or paid short-term positions for international graduate students on F-1 visas. These internships or paid positions need to be relevant to the program of study. In particular, projects proposed for this course should contribute to better understanding of the methods and techniques learned in the program courses or lead to learning new techniques associated with the subjects of the program. Furthermore, many conditions need to be fulfilled as directed by the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS). In particular, students must remain in good standing throughout the practicum; prior approval of the graduate program coordinator, in consultation with the student\u2019s academic advisor, is required for enrollment; the student must show evidence of a real commitment from a specific employer for a specific project, with preferably a detailed description of the project and job responsibilities. All these materials, including a job offer letter, must be provided to the program coordinator with sufficient advance notice so that the program coordinator has time to review the materials and determine if the project is appropriate. During the semester, the student must submit written monthly progress reports. At the end of the semester, the student must submit for grading a written report that describes their activities, even if the project is ongoing. The student must also present their activities in an accompanying oral presentation that is also graded. This is a one-credit course that may be repeated up to a total of three credits.",

The course provides a study of the interrelationship and propagation of effects that systems and design changes have on one another, especially in relation to nuclear power plant operations and safety. Emphasis is placed on how operations of and faults in systems and components can influence reactivity and core behavior. The students will examine a typical nuclear power plant and those components and systems of the nuclear plant system that have the potential for affecting core power and whose failure could be an initiating event for a plant transient. One main outcome is the ability to predict behavior under complex interactions among systems and to predict transient behavior of the integrated nuclear plant considering factors that are important for safe and efficient operation of the plant including reactivity management and control, coolant inventory control and core heat removal. A replica simulator (PCTRAN) is used as an effective way for students to understand accident control, emergency operating procedures and plant control. The course includes case studies and design projects.",

    course_description:
      "Many major medical device design practices have been established or changed as a result of an event or group of events. This course examines current practices and their relationship to events which shaped them, providing rationale and historical context for these practices. Spanning the past century, this course begins by examining events which shaped early medical device regulations and standards. It describes the ramifications of those events and how guidelines and rules for medical device design were formulated or changed as a result. It then reviews unique considerations in current medical device design practices, including regulatory, research and reimbursement practices and special challenges in clinical use. Medical devices that were marketed but resulted in poor outcomes or with technical flaws are studied to illustrate general themes among goals and needs for improved medical device design practices in the future. Aiming to expose students to broadly relevant and current issues, in its entirety, this course reviews the top causes of death, the most expensive diseases and illnesses, and current performance issues with common medical devices. Each lesson summarizes at least one critical element of design strategy for medical devices. Selected examples represent common medical device design challenges. This course is geared toward students seeking or recently entering a career in medical devices. In many cases, medical device practices were based upon practices established for drug regulation, and so relevant pharmaceutical industry developments are also presented, making this course interesting and pertinent to a student pursuing a career in the pharmaceutical field as well. It is also strongly applicable to those pursuing careers involving technology in clinical settings, including hospitals, and in pre-clinical/clinical research. The material that is presented includes highlights from several hundred references. Most of the references are publicly available. Students are encouraged to review the references in their entirety if they want to know more about a topic. Recognizing the multi-disciplinary nature of this field, the course is suitable for a student in any engineering and science program.",

Biofeedback is used in rehabilitation and in other movement-training paradigms to facilitate motor (re-)learning \u2013 conveying biological sensor data to the end-user either concurrently (real-time) or terminally, after the movement is complete. For example, one emerging type of real-time biofeedback uses precise musical cues to convey biomechanics metrics to help people learn movement skills. Students will work in groups to design and experimentally evaluate an audio and/or visual biofeedback device of their choosing, as they develop skills using biomechanical sensors through lab assignments and communicate their device development in an IEEE-style paper. An additional unique aspect of the course is its community engagement: students will share their designs with younger students and/or the public, which will build students\u2019 abilities to present and teach new concepts.',

Such scientific basis consists of atom arrangements, defects, temperature effect on atom arrangements, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Energy is used as a unifying theme throughout the course to explain engineering properties such as melting temperature, thermal expansion, diffusivity, fracture, and creep. Instead of addressing polymers, metals, and ceramics separately, this course uses an integrated approach to discussing engineering properties of these materials under the same scenarios. For example, fracture of metals, ceramics and polymers is discussed together to show the similarities and differences in behaviors and causes. Topics covered also include phase diagrams (e.g., SMA), mechanical properties, viscoelastic behavior, functional materials, composites, and fatigue. Materials selection and cost analysis discussed is useful for engineers to choose appropriate materials for their engineering designs.",

Design thinking involves a unique form of inquiry which goes well beyond product and service design. Students will develop an appreciation for design and develop skills for studying design systems. These concepts and methods have wide applicability as they can be used to design organizations of people, information structures, compensation systems as well as the entire consumer experience. Applying these approaches can often create entirely new systems that are more useful and usable. The logic of this approach can sometimes solve "wicked problems" which have defied previous solutions.',

The goal is to create a stable, resilient shoreline that enhances the natural ecosystem. This course is designed to fit an industry need for engineers that are familiar with traditional coastal engineering concepts as well as ecology and/or bioengineering. This will be accomplished through lectures focused on the characteristics of natural organisms (flora and fauna) that contribute to the stability and ecological enhancement of traditional coastal structures. Some of the topics to be presented in this class include evaluating site conditions, integrating ecological considerations with engineering requirements, determining representative costs and understanding project regulations.

The basic conservation laws and the applications of the basic equations of motion are discussed in the context of synoptic scale meteorology. The thermodynamics of the atmosphere are derived based on the equation of state of the atmosphere with specific emphasis on adiabatic and pseudo-adiabatic motions. The concept of atmospheric stability is presented in terms of the moist and dry lapse rate. The influence of the planetary boundary layer on atmospheric motions is presented with emphasis on topographic and open ocean frictional effects, temperature discontinuity between land and sea, and the generation of sea breezes. The mesoscale dynamics of tornadoes and hurricanes are discussed as well as the cyclogenesis of extratropical coast allows. The course makes use of a multitude of web-based products including interactive learning sites, weather forecasts from the National Weather Service (NWS), tropical predictions from the National Hurricane Center and NWS model outputs (AVN, NGM, ETA, and WAM).",

Throughout the course complex objects will be reduced to their essential features that explain the observed phenomena. Current and historic observations will be used as the motivation. Data analysis assignments will be given from real observational data (listed as \u2019Lab\u2019 in the syllabus). A set of semester-long group projects in astro-photography will give students a hands-on experience in imaging astronomical phenomena using everyday digital cameras(listed as \u2019Project\u2019 in the syllabus). The course will include an evening demonstration on campus and a visit to the planetarium. In terms of general education, astronomy will be used as a vehicle to introduce the essentials of model-building, justified simplifications, physical reasoning and self- correcting nature of scientific method.",

      "Simple physics can be used to analyze the biological systems on the vastly different scales ranging from the cell organelles to the entire ecosystems. We will study the laws of physics in biological context and the limits of their applicability, i.e. the interplay of physical simplifications and biological complexities. We will also study the effect of geological and astronomical phenomena on biological systems. The course has a 'discovery' project component with statistical analysis of the biological data collected in image analysis, field studies, and computer simulations.",

    course_description:
      "Computing the quantum mechanical properties of many body systems has always been a great challenge. Approximate methods such as the Hartree-Fock and Density functional methods have been used but calculating the atomization energy of compounds accurately can take days using conventional techniques. Machine learning approaches to these problems have begun to show substantial improvement over traditional methods with respect to accuracy and efficiency. In other areas such as particle physics, where large amounts of collision data need to be analyzed rapidly and accurately, supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques have shown initial success. This is not only defined by the extremely successful running and analysis of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data, but also by the availability of cosmological and astrophysical observations. Another aspect is the use of quantum systems to enhance the speed and power of traditionally slow machine learning techniques leading to the new exciting field of quantum machine learning. Both the use of classical machine learning applied to the analysis of quantum physics and the application of quantum systems to enhance classical machine learning algorithms will be discussed. Standard machine learning methods along with the basics of quantum information will be reviewed.",

      "This course is designed for undergraduate students in Quantitative Finance. In order for students to be able to price derivatives, they must first understand the behavior of the underlying. To this end, the students will need to understand how many of the most common stock models are created and utilized. At the core of this is understanding Brownian motion and other adapted stochastic processes from a conceptual level, which requires the knowledge of quadratic variation, martingales, and filtrations. Using these building blocks, many different structures of stock and interest rate processes can be developed: geometric Brownian motion, stochastic volatility models, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and Vasicek to name a few. After this course, the students will be able to price simple derivatives based on some of these models. In addition, through the use of stochastic integration, students will have a better understanding of portfolio valuation. By the end of this course, the student will be able to derive in its entirety the Black-Scholes-Merton European option pricing formula for Geometric Brownian Motion.",

    course_title: "Risk Management for Capital Markets",
    course_description:
      'Risk Control and derivative pricing are major concerns for financial institutions. Yet, as recent events have shown us there is a real need for adequate statistical tools to measure and anticipate the amplitude of the potential moves of the financial market. Many of the standard models seen on Wall Street however are based on simplified assumptions and can lead to systematic (and sometimes dramatic) underestimation of real risks. Starting from a detailed analysis of market data, one can take into account more faithfully the real behavior of financial markets (in particular the rare events) for asset allocation, derivative pricing and hedging, and risk control. This course will introduce some concepts to better address these issues. There will also be a few sessions in the Hanlon lab learning to use a Bloomberg terminal. Various financial instruments will be presented in a form familiar to Wall Street traders (i.e. Bloomberg screens). The purpose of Risk Management is to provide a valuation of these financial contracts ("pricing") and to provide various measures of risk and methods to hedge these risks as best as possible ("hedging"). These tasks are not just performed by Risk Managers but by "Traders" who price and hedge their respective trading books on a daily basis. Successful trading (over extended periods of time) comes down to successful risk management. Successful risk management comes down to robust valuation which is the main prerogative of Financial Engineering. Valuation of financial instruments begins with an analysis of possible future events (i.e. stock price moves, interest rate moves, defaults, etc.). Dealing with the future involves the mathematics of statistics and probability. The first step is to find a probability distribution that is suitable for the financial instrument at hand. The next step is to calibrate this distribution. The third step is to generate future events using this calibrated distribution and based on this, provide the necessary valuation and risk measures for the financial contract at hand. The failure of any of these steps can lead to incorrect valuation and therefore an incorrect assessment of the risks of the financial instrument under consideration.',

Using state-of- the-industry mission design and analysis tools (provided), the task is to apply systems engineering process to define top- level system requirements and design key elements of the system. The end result will be a system design review during which students present and defend their design decisions. In part 2 of the course, students experience system realization processes first-hand by integrating, verifying, validating and delivering the shoe box-sized EyasSAT educational satellite. Lecture is combined with hands-on experience. From the part-level to the system level, students will implement a rigorous assembly, integration, verification and validation plan on real hardware and software applying "test like you fly, fly like you test" principles.',

It analyzes customer needs, objectives and requirements, through launch and transportation system design, development, test and manufacturing to creating operations concepts and infrastructure capabilities. Lifecycle cost and the business case will be assessed. The thrust of this course is to identify technical risk and mitigate it in the most cost-effective manner, while maintaining the technical integrity of the vehicle(s) and infrastructure. In the course you will take a fresh look at space launch and transportation systems by emphasizing a process-oriented approach for creating cost-effective concepts to meet customer needs and objectives. This process describes how to translate SLaTS objectives, requirements, and constraints into viable and cost-effective operations concepts. Vehicle design presentations show practical, detailed approaches and tools to analyze and design manned and unmanned, reusable and expendable vehicles for both launch and interplanetary systems, including architecture and configuration, payloads, and vehicle subsystems. Course presentations on launch operations describe the functions to be performed, define and evaluate the key issues, help you develop an appropriate operations concept, and assess the complexity and cost of operations. Special emphasis is placed on describing the interrelationships and tradeoffs between system design and launch operations that must occur during the early stages of planning in order to deliver effective systems.",

Delivered as a combination of lectures and seminars, we can begin to address questions such as "How do we measure functionality at the many scales that affect community?" and "How are their benefits and costs delivered to each significantly different community within the city?" Finally, "How do we measure the resilience we seek to achieve at a community level?"',

Given the strategic nature of early design decisions, the participants will also learn selected multiattribute design decision and risk analysis methodologies, including Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). As part of the emphasis on maintainability, the module addresses issues such as accessibility, standardization, modularization, testability, mobility, interchangeability and serviceability, and the relevant methods, tools, and techniques. Further, the students will learn to exploit this phase of the system design and development process to impart enhanced supportability to the design configuration being developed through an explicit focus on configuration commonality and interchangeability, use of standard parts and fasteners, adherence to open system standards and profiles, and use of standard networking and communication protocols. Examples and case studies will be used to facilitate understanding of these principles and concepts.",

      "Many social-technical systems in healthcare, energy and urban systems can be considered as multi-agent systems where different agents \u2013people, organizations or autonomous technologies- with heterogeneous, and often opposing objectives interact and shape the complex collective behavior and evolving nature of such systems. Analysis, design and governance and design of such systems can be very challenging and require rigorous agent-based thinking rooted in analytical models. This course teaches fundamentals of multi-agent systems, starting from models of single agent decision making and planning under uncertainty, and moves to basic frameworks for multi-agent system analysis tools, with a focus on game theory and complex network analysis . The course will take a combination of analytical and conceptual methods, and will use agent- based simulation techniques rooted in these methods. Students will apply the course material to a real-world project, close to their area of dissertation research.",

    course_description:
      "It takes something special for the term system to have such ubiquity. The downside is that it is overused, improperly so, detracting from its power. This class builds upon a solid conceptual foundation to ensure that the system/enterprise is properly defined, conceived, and realized. Uniquely, the class shows how it is possible to use systems in order to think more deeply and to act more decisively. This approach is made possible by emphasizing the simultaneity of perspectives, the role of paradox, and the centrality of soft issues in resolving complexity. The SystemitoolTM is used to structure and conduct analysis of decisions. This class is aimed at policy and decision-makers at all levels in an organization.",

Topics include identification of system level architecture alternatives and considerations, including definition of objectives for physical (hardware) and logical (software) structure, information and system assurance, behavior, cost, performance and human integration based on the system concept at every level of system decomposition. System of System (SoS) architecture is examined, addressing composition of multiple systems and engineering new, emergent behavior in the SoS. Examples used will come from a variety of operational environments (e.g. communications systems, space systems, weapon systems, etc) Special consideration is given to the importance of effective construction and transitioning of the SysML models to software engineering for software intensive systems projects.",

The eleven topics listed can be expanded or contracted depending on how students react to the material. E.g. the topic of functions of two variables can be changed by emphasizing discrete functions and their relationship to joint distributions. Some topics (e.g. coordinates in the plane and functions) may require two sessions. However, it is planned to cover the entire material in 13 sessions.",
