If the instructor agrees that you are adequately prepared for the course, he/she will finish filling out the form, digitally sign it, then email it back to you. You can then present the signed form to the Registrar and you will be allowed into the course. Note that only the course instructor can waive the prerequisite, not your advisor."

            answer="There is no limit on the number of WebCampus courses that a US student may take. International students are required to take at least 6 credits of classroom courses per semester. Since most graduate courses are 3 credits, an international student registered for 9 credits may take at most one WebCampus course that semester; an international student registered for 12 credits may take at most two WebCampus courses that semester. There is no limit on the total number of WebCampus courses that may be applied to an international student's degree, only a per-semester limit implied by the 6-credit rule."
