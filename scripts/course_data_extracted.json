From the viewpoint of the process simulations, the course is divided into four categories: Component, property and data management; Unit operations; System simulation; and Process economic evaluation. The equations used by the simulator are discussed as well as convergence methods, loops and tear streams and scrutiny of default settings in the simulator. The factored cost method and profitability measures are reviewed and compared to simulator results. Work on a capstone design project is begun in the last section of the course.",

    "course_description": "Personal computing is now mobile and cloud-based. Disconnected mobile computing challenges many of the assumptions underlying much of today's distributed systems. \"Cloud computing\" provides a powerful background computing facility for mobile devices, but also raises important issues of trust and privacy. Many of these issues arise in critical yet sensitive domains such as electronic healthcare delivery. Mobile computing applications are location-aware or context-aware; the privacy implications of these applications are profound. Mobile, and increasingly location aware, gaming systems are now one of the largest sectors of the world entertainment industry. The purpose of this course is to review the fundamentals of mobile systems and applications, and how they relate to services in the cloud. The course will review material from wireless communication, distributed systems, and security and privacy, as they pertain to the systems being studied. The course will involve programming mobile apps using a popular mobile computing platform, such as Android or iPhone, to get hands-on experience with the concepts being discussed in the class.

More importantly, is it possible to achieve the best of the two worlds, or there has to be some trade-off. This course will introduce students to concepts relating the computational efficiency and the statistical accuracy for a broad range of problems, including regression, classification, clustering, adaptive learning, to name a few. It will cover popular numerical methods that carry out state-of-the-art performance on the computational side, and it will also discuss possible improvement in the price of estimation accuracy and memory usage. The goal of the course is to help students understand these trade-offs from a theoretical perspective and guide them to design near-optimal algorithms for real-world problems.",

Since many wireless systems involve connections among hardware developed by different commercial manufacturers, national and international standards play a major role in the evolution of wireless systems. Earlier first generation systems evolved to today\u2019s second generation systems, with third generation systems expected shortly. One component of this course relates to these important standards. There are several fundamentally different wireless systems applications simultaneously evolving. Some relate to personal communications services (e.g., cellular telephony, wireless modems, etc.). Others relate to LANs, implemented in wireless rather than wired technologies to allow mobility or ease of access but providing data rates competitive with wired systems. Satellite communications systems (e.g., the Iridium system) are emerging and promise to provide a particularly interesting means of extending communication services. GPS systems provide an important means of determining one\u2019s position to high accuracy. Digital and software radios exploit the familiar concept of radio transmissions to provide digital information (and draw upon channel assignment schemes related to the radio metaphor). In addition to the commercial development of separate (and non-integrated) wireless systems of the various types above, there are important military applications in which the various systems are integrated to provide a versatile communications systems designed for battlefield applications. Upon completion of this course, the student will have depth of understanding in the high-level, systems-oriented view of wireless systems.",

By resolving questions of rhetoric and language through text analysis and class discussions, students become more critical readers and effective writers. Additionally, refining the use of stylistic tools, such as structure, syntax, and vocabulary, will result in clearer and more precise written and verbal communication. Through a variety of task-based activities, such as email writing, Problem-Solution and Process writing, data commentary, and summary writing, the ELC 90 student will have the opportunity to improve the communication of both sourced and non-sourced information. Students will also refine critical elements of pronunciation by giving formal and informal presentations.",

The primary task of the course will be to develop visual literacy and familiarity with the complex and contradictory genres and social functions of photographic image production. At the same time, this course will introduce the difficulty of writing the history of photography as a separate discipline that operates both inside and outside histories of modern art.",

To this end, the course strengthens the students\u2019 ability to identify and respond to the basic musical building blocks - melody, harmony, rhythm, tempo, tone color and form - and to the ways individual composers combine these elements to express and communicate substantive musical ideas. The course is not intended as a historical survey of the Western musical canon. Rather, it focuses on important core works in the genres of symphonic, chamber, and choral and solo vocal music, primarily from the common practice period extending from the late Renaissance to the late Romantic period, without excluding important trends and developments in earlier (medieval) and later (modern, post- modern) periods. The aim throughout is to focus on works that an interested music lover is liable to hear in live performance, and that form a basis for further musical exploration. At the same time, the course provides, without losing this central focus, at least brief exposure and consideration of selected examples of both world music and commercial pop music in some of its various forms. Finally, and unique to the Music and Technology program at Stevens, the course draws special attention, wherever appropriate, to important milestones in the development of music technology and their impact on the development of musical style.",

The first portion of the class focuses on elements of convex analysis and subgradient calculus for non-smooth functions, optimality conditions for differentiable and for non-smooth optimization problems, and Lagrangian duality. The main part of the class discusses numerical methods for optimization with a focus and application to problems arising in data science. Approaches to large-scale/big-data optimization include decomposition methods, design of distributed and parallel methods of optimization, as well as stochastic approximation methods. Examples of optimization models in classification, clustering, statistical learning, compressed sensing will be discussed in order to illustrate the theoretical and numerical challenges, and to demonstrate the scope of applications. Numerical projects will involve some coding and numerical experiments in python. The students are expected to have undergraduate knowledge in multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and probability.",

The old and new rank-structured tensor formats are presented, as: canonical, Tucker, hierarchical, tensor train, quantized tensor train formats and their generalizations, which leads to tensor networks, i.e. representation of high dimensional tensors as interconnected low dimensional tensors in variety of ways. Under suitable conditions these formats allow a stable representation and a reduction of the data size from exponential complexity (with respect to the dimension of the space) to a linear complexity, which kills the curse of dimensionality. Another goal of the course is to present variety of relatively novel unsupervised machine learning methods using matrix and tensor decompositions, as latent variable analysis based on (1) statistical independence and (2) sparsity assumptions, kernel and generalized principal component analysis, and non-negative tensor decomposition, all of which reveal hidden patterns in the data.",

This course introduces the widely used finite difference and finite element methods and discusses conditions under which the numerical schemes are stable and converge to the true solutions of the PDEs; the latter is critical for understanding when the predictions from the approximations obtained by the numerical methods can be trusted. The course also offers projects, where the students can implement the finite difference and finite element methods for proposed problems.

TDA-based algorithms have been successfully used for tasks such as identifying new cancer types, detecting warning signals for imminent financial market crashes, and optimizing materials for methane capture. As a generalization of graphs, simplical complexes formed from data are used for recognizing topological properties algorithmically and are introduced with natural motivating examples from areas such as neuroscience and multi-agent decision tasks. With this in mind, we turn to algebraic topology, specifically simplicial homology, and then follow the development and implementation of persistent homology. Common challenges in data science, such as clustering and dimension reduction, are repeated themes and appear naturally in the Mapper algorithm. Examples of applications are given throughout the course, with coding mostly in Python. Prerequisites: Undergraduate linear algebra, basic familiarity with Python, Matlab or R",

Emphasis is placed on how operations of and faults in systems and components can influence reactivity and core behavior. The students will examine a typical nuclear power plant and those components and systems of the nuclear plant system that have the potential for affecting core power and whose failure could be an initiating event for a plant transient. One main outcome is the ability to predict behavior under complex interactions among systems and to predict transient behavior of the integrated nuclear plant considering factors that are important for safe and efficient operation of the plant including reactivity management and control, coolant inventory control and core heat removal. A replica simulator (PCTRAN) is used as an effective way for students to understand accident control, emergency operating procedures and plant control.

This course examines current practices and their relationship to events which shaped them, providing rationale and historical context for these practices. Spanning the past century, this course begins by examining events which shaped early medical device regulations and standards. It describes the ramifications of those events and how guidelines and rules for medical device design were formulated or changed as a result. It then reviews unique considerations in current medical device design practices, including regulatory, research and reimbursement practices and special challenges in clinical use. Medical devices that were marketed but resulted in poor outcomes or with technical flaws are studied to illustrate general themes among goals and needs for improved medical device design practices in the future. Aiming to expose students to broadly relevant and current issues, in its entirety, this course reviews the top causes of death, the most expensive diseases and illnesses, and current performance issues with common medical devices. Each lesson summarizes at least one critical element of design strategy for medical devices. Selected examples represent common medical device design challenges. This course is geared toward students seeking or recently entering a career in medical devices. In many cases, medical device practices were based upon practices established for drug regulation, and so relevant pharmaceutical industry developments are also presented, making this course interesting and pertinent to a student pursuing a career in the pharmaceutical field as well. It is also strongly applicable to those pursuing careers involving technology in clinical settings, including hospitals, and in pre-clinical/clinical research. The material that is presented includes highlights from several hundred references. Most of the references are publicly available. Students are encouraged to review the references in their entirety if they want to know more about a topic. Recognizing the multi-disciplinary nature of this field, the course is suitable for a student in any engineering and science program.",

Machine learning approaches to these problems have begun to show substantial improvement over traditional methods with respect to accuracy and efficiency. In other areas such as particle physics, where large amounts of collision data need to be analyzed rapidly and accurately, supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques have shown initial success. This is not only defined by the extremely successful running and analysis of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data, but also by the availability of cosmological and astrophysical observations. Another aspect is the use of quantum systems to enhance the speed and power of traditionally slow machine learning techniques leading to the new exciting field of quantum machine learning. Both the use of classical machine learning applied to the analysis of quantum physics and the application of quantum systems to enhance classical machine learning algorithms will be discussed. Standard machine learning methods along with the basics of quantum information will be reviewed.",

Using these building blocks, many different structures of stock and interest rate processes can be developed: geometric Brownian motion, stochastic volatility models, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and Vasicek to name a few. After this course, the students will be able to price simple derivatives based on some of these models. In addition, through the use of stochastic integration, students will have a better understanding of portfolio valuation.

    "course_description": "Risk Control and derivative pricing are major concerns for financial institutions. Yet, as recent events have shown us there is a real need for adequate statistical tools to measure and anticipate the amplitude of the potential moves of the financial market. Many of the standard models seen on Wall Street however are based on simplified assumptions and can lead to systematic (and sometimes dramatic) underestimation of real risks. Starting from a detailed analysis of market data, one can take into account more faithfully the real behavior of financial markets (in particular the rare events) for asset allocation, derivative pricing and hedging, and risk control. This course will introduce some concepts to better address these issues. There will also be a few sessions in the Hanlon lab learning to use a Bloomberg terminal. Various financial instruments will be presented in a form familiar to Wall Street traders (i.e. Bloomberg screens). The purpose of Risk Management is to provide a valuation of these financial contracts (\"pricing\") and to provide various measures of risk and methods to hedge these risks as best as possible (\"hedging\"). These tasks are not just performed by Risk Managers but by \"Traders\" who price and hedge their respective trading books on a daily basis. Successful trading (over extended periods of time) comes down to successful risk management. Successful risk management comes down to robust valuation which is the main prerogative of Financial Engineering. Valuation of financial instruments begins with an analysis of possible future events (i.e. stock price moves, interest rate moves, defaults, etc.). Dealing with the future involves the mathematics of statistics and probability. The first step is to find a probability distribution that is suitable for the financial instrument at hand. The next step is to calibrate this distribution. The third step is to generate future events using this calibrated distribution and based on this, provide the necessary valuation and risk measures for the financial contract at hand. The failure of any of these steps can lead to incorrect valuation and therefore an incorrect assessment of the risks of the financial instrument under consideration.",

    "course_description": "Broadband Service Management is a comprehensive course for those interested in deploying and operating broadband networks from a technical and managerial aspect. A broadband networks success is based on its ability to deliver a desired service with a specific service requirement referred to as a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The Service Level Management whether it is with an operator, infrastructure vendor, Third Party Vendor (3PV) or customer all have specific Key Performance Indicators (KPI) associated with them. The ability to define, identify, and manage those Key Performance Indicators associated with a broadband network Service Level Agreement requires a thorough understanding of the entire broadband ecosystem. The course will present key topics and criteria required to implement and sustain a network. Emphasis will be placed on the ability to define performance quantities and manage the network balancing business risks while minimizing costs to meet the objectives of the broadband network.",
